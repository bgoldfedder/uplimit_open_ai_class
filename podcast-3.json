She was dating a married man and he snuck her into his house while his wife was at work. He ended up making her go into the closet and she was stuck into a coat closet for almost an hour after his friend showed up unexpectedly. She says, I think he should have told a friend he was in the middle of something and he needed to come back. But he sat and talked to this man for a good while. What would have happened if his wife had come home? She says, in her opinion, his wife should be the only person she plays second fiddle to. Should I take a break from this married man until he makes her a priority in his life? Well, first of all, you have to understand, you're not the one that can determine who you play second fiddle to. You have no, you have no. You can't determine who you play second fiddle to. You second fiddle to the wife and now you find out you second fiddle to this dude. So now, already now, you're in the third fiddle position. You're on third fiddle. Like you could stop playing your fiddle and the band would still continue. You see what I mean? You're moving down on who you're playing fiddle to. Now, I'm going to tell you right now, you're lucky it was the man that came home. You're lucky it was a friend that came home because when the wife come home, you're going to be shot as an intruder. You want a man that's going to be in the closet. He's going to shoot you as an intruder. All over this woman's house, girl. Now, listen to these. You can't believe you got snuck into the closet, but you got snuck into the house though. Hello. See, once you get into the sneak game, the sneak game got levels. I don't know why y'all people be taking people to your main address. That's such a level of disrespect. I mean, look, man, you hear the old saying that there's honor amongst the thieves. Criminals even have an honor code. You can't do nothing to no children and you can't do nothing to no woman. You go to prison for rape and you go to prison for child molestation. Them two right there, they finna hurt you, man, because it's an honor code. Look, man, we know we doing stuff wrong, but these two, they off limits. See, that's a code. So there's a code to everything and you got to understand the codes. And once you get snuck into the house, it's levels to that. And you can't make no determinate until he make you a priority. A priority over what? You're not a priority over his friends or his wife. Ever. Why would you go in somebody's house? Man, why would you go to somebody's house? But what's deeper is what's wrong with this man to sneak you in a house? Take you over there. Bro, get your ass a hotel room. At least be respectful of the code. Just damn, dog. You ain't got to... Look, man, you can make mistakes with women. We've all made them, but you ain't got to dog nobody, man. Damn, dog. You ain't got to dog nobody out. You know, man, if you're going to do something because you're having a moment of weakness or your temptation win, okay, all right, all right, I got that. I ain't passing no judgment. But dog, you ain't got to dog nobody out. You're going to bring a woman to your wife's house. She done poured her heart and soul in there making it a home for you and you're going to bring somebody to the house? That's a low down mess right there, man. That's low down. But let me say this. I've been in these coat closets. If you're going to put people in these coat closets, have some coolers or some water or something. So when we're thirsty, you better get... You know what I'm saying? I've been in a coat closet. I know what it's like. What? That's what you got to do. But if we in there and we thirsty and we got to be in there for a while, we're going to need some nourishment. I mean, have something to snack on in these coat closets. You know you're going to be putting people in there. This is an ignorant show. Coming up... Put a fold-away chair in there. I'm not seeing this woman doing it. Give me a blanket so I can catch a nap. 20 minutes after the hour, we will have more of this ignorant show, the Steve Harvey Morning Show, right after this.
